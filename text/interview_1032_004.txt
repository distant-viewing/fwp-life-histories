GREEK STUDY NORTH CAROLINA
Elizabeth City
Others Who Have Prospered
There are fourteen native Greeks in Elizabeth City, N. C., five of whom are married, 6 of whom are naturalized. Three have married native American wives and two have built homes and are rearing families. One married in his old country; another married in France and is bringing his family to America.
Elizabeth City Greeks are law-abiding, sober, industrious, self-supporting and accepted as a wholesome cross section of the local population. If they have differences amongst themselves, they settle them amongst themselves. They have never been subject of indictment in any criminal or civil action, except for one lone individual who has become so thoroughly Americanized that he gets drunk once or twice a year, at which time the police say "he is fussy, but gives them no trouble."
All members of the colony were originally members of the Greek Orthodox Church, but most of them have dropped their church memberships, there being no Greek Church in Elizabeth City. Two have affiliated with local Protestant Christian Churches.
The first Greek to settle in Elizabeth City was Harry G. Paulos, deceased, who established a successful restaurant here about 35 years ago. He married a local girl, native American, acquired a small farm home near the city and is survived by his wife and five children, the three elder boys of whom are holding good positions, one of them assistant manager of one of the leading chain stores in this city.
